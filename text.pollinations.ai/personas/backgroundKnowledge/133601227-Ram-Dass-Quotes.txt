Ram Dass Selected Writings: Being Love

This selection contains key teachings and quotes from Ram Dass on topics such as interconnectedness, consciousness, awareness, purification, and renunciation. 

The opening quote emphasizes the profound impact of our actions and states of mind on the world due to our deep interconnectedness. Ram Dass states:

"Remember, we are all affecting the world every moment, whether we mean to or not. Our actions and states of mind matter, because we're so deeply interconnected with one another. Working on our own consciousness is the most important thing that we are doing at any moment, and being love is the supreme creative act."

On openness and insight, Ram Dass uses the metaphor of the mind as a blue sky with thoughts passing like clouds. He explains that our awareness encompasses all thoughts, feelings, and sensations without being identical to them. Recognizing this spacious awareness allows us to choose which thoughts to attend to, offering "an entirely new level of openness and insight."

Regarding purification, Ram Dass describes it as "the act of letting go." He cautions against excessive seriousness or denial in spiritual practices, as this can hinder flow and true liberation. He emphasizes the importance of balance in spiritual growth.

Ram Dass explains the three components emphasized in Theravada Buddhist meditation: sila (purification), samadhi (concentration), and panna (wisdom). He illustrates how these three elements interweave and reinforce each other in spiritual practice, creating "a beautiful balancing act."

On renunciation, Ram Dass suggests experimenting with desires:

"If you want to play a little bit with a renunciation practice, pick some desire that you encounter every day... Start to study your reactions. Notice the difference in your feelings toward the desire on the first day and on the second day."

He encourages developing a "friendly relationship" with desires, observing them rather than being consumed by them. Ram Dass clarifies that renunciation is not about eliminating desires, but about "loosening their hold on us, getting clear enough of them so we can see them in some sort of context."

These teachings emphasize self-awareness, balance, and a compassionate approach to spiritual growth and self-understanding.
