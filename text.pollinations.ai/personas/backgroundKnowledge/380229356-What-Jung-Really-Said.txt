This selection provides a detailed overview of Carl Jung's life, work, and key concepts in analytical psychology. Some key points include:

- Jung's early career and break with Freud: The text describes Jung's education in Basel, his work at the Burghölzli Hospital, and his initial collaboration and eventual split with Sigmund Freud. It quotes Jung on their differences: "Freud's attitude towards the spirit seemed to me highly questionable. Wherever, in a person or in a work of art, an expression of spirituality (in the intellectual, not the supernatural sense) came to light, he suspected it, and insinuated that it was repressed sexuality."

- Key Jungian concepts: The selection explains important ideas like the collective unconscious, archetypes, psychological types (introversion/extraversion), and the process of individuation. It quotes Jung on archetypes: "The concept of the archetype...is derived from the repeated observation that, for instance, the myths and fairytales of world literature contain definite motifs which crop up everywhere."

- Jung's approach to psychotherapy: The text details Jung's methods, including dream analysis, active imagination, and working with the transference. It emphasizes Jung's focus on the whole personality and quotes him: "The analyst has to establish a relationship with both halves of his patient's personality, because only from them can be put together a whole and complete man."

- Jung's later work: The selection covers Jung's interest in alchemy, his views on religion and spirituality, and his thoughts on modern society. It includes Jung's statement on God from a BBC interview: "I do not need to believe in God; I know."

- Jung's legacy: The text concludes by discussing Jung's ongoing influence and the future of analytical psychology. It quotes Jung on the potential for further development: "The second generation has the advantage of a clearer, if still incomplete, picture; certain landmarks that at least lie on the frontiers of the essential have grown familiar, and one now knows what must be known if one is to explore the newly discovered territory."

Throughout, the selection emphasizes Jung's empirical approach, his openness to new ideas, and his focus on the individual's journey towards wholeness. It provides a comprehensive overview of Jungian psychology while retaining key quotes and concepts in Jung's own words.

“The acceptance of oneself is the essence of the whole moral problem and the epitome of a whole outlook on life. That I feed the hungry, that I forgive an insult, that I love my enemy in the name of Christ -- all these are undoubtedly great virtues. What I do unto the least of my brethren, that I do unto Christ. But what if I should discover that the least among them all, the poorest of all the beggars, the most impudent of all the offenders, the very enemy himself -- that these are within me, and that I myself stand in need of the alms of my own kindness -- that I myself am the enemy who must be loved -- what then? As a rule, the Christian's attitude is then reversed; there is no longer any question of love or long-suffering; we say to the brother within us "Raca," and condemn and rage against ourselves. We hide it from the world; we refuse to admit ever having met this least among the lowly in ourselves.”
