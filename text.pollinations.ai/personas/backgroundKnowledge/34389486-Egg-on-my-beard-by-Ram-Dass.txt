This text is a detailed account by Ram Dass of his experience with a spiritual teacher named Joya, which he describes as a cautionary tale about false teachers and spiritual materialism. 

The piece begins with a quote from Z'ev ben Shimon Halevi's book "The Way of Kabbalah", warning about the dangers of studying with false teachers, especially those who have reached some level of realization but use their powers to manipulate others. Halevi states:

"...is the man who has reached some level of realization. His quality is usually enigmatic, and he often possesses remarkable powers which he uses to intrigue and manipulate people who are not so evolved as himself...Alas, such men have the ability to fascinate and imprison people by their personal charisma, which is the exact reverse of Kabbalah, whose object is to free men from bondage…"

Ram Dass explains that after his guru Neemkaroli Baba (Maharaj-ji) died in 1973, he felt lost and was seeking guidance. In 1974, he had a vision of Maharaj-ji telling him, "You don't have to go to India. Your teachings will be right here." This led him to New York, where he met Joya.

For 15 months, Ram Dass studied intensively with Joya, who claimed to be various divine entities, including Kali, Athena, and the Mother of the Universe. He describes the experience as being "like being in a tornado—or a clothes dryer." Joya's teachings involved intense confrontations, trance states, and claims of miraculous powers.

Ram Dass lists several factors that contributed to his surrender to Joya's reality:

1. The intensity of the confrontations forced his ego defenses to surface.
2. Joya's charisma and apparent ability to enter deep trance states.
3. His own ego's vulnerability to being told he was special.
4. A powerful vision he had had years earlier that seemed to validate Joya's claims.
5. Reports from others about his own psychic activities that he was unaware of.
6. His desire to overcome his attachments to sexuality.
7. His struggle to connect with the concept of the Divine Mother, which Joya claimed to embody.
8. His wish for Maharaj-ji to still guide him, which Joya seemed to fulfill by claiming to channel him.

The text details various bizarre and manipulative behaviors by Joya, including emotional blackmail, expensive demands for gold jewelry, and claims of taking on others' illnesses. Ram Dass admits he rationalized these behaviors and continued to surrender to Joya's teachings.

Eventually, doubts began to grow. Ram Dass describes a gradual disillusionment as Joya's behavior became more erratic and her teachings less profound. He tried to leave, but Joya and her followers harassed him intensely, even attempting to break into his apartment.

As Ram Dass left Joya's group, along with many other disillusioned followers, the truth began to unravel. He learned that many of Joya's claims and dramatic episodes had been fabrications, including her supposed illnesses and spiritual powers.

In reflecting on this experience, Ram Dass ponders various interpretations of what happened, from gullibility and spiritual materialism to possible mental illness or misuse of spiritual powers. He concludes that while he and some others gained valuable lessons from the experience, others were hurt by it.

Ram Dass ends with an important lesson:

"There is an aura that surrounds tantric teachings which implies that the ends justify the means. For a liberated tantric teacher, such a morality may be possible. For a teacher with any attachment, it is not."

He emphasizes the importance of truth, quoting Maharaj-ji's insistence on telling the truth no matter how embarrassing. Ram Dass concludes that while one shouldn't fear taking teachings out of concern for the teacher's purity, discrimination remains an invaluable protection. He admits he got caught due to his own spiritual greed and insufficient faith in Maharaj-ji, but hopes others can learn from his example:

"You too may get caught and suffer deep disappointment and confusion. But I hope that you may learn something from my example and save yourself a big detour, if your longing for God is pure, this is your strength. Then though you may get lost for a time, you will in the end hear clearly in your inner heart what to do, and all the impurities around you will just become more grist for the mill of your awakening."
