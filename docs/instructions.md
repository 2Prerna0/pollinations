### Instructions

1. Visit the URL [pollinations.ai](https://pollinations.ai) (preferably in Google Chrome).
2. Click on `NodeID -> [ LAUNCH ]`. A new browser tab will launch.
3. In the new tab, click `Runtime --> Run All`.
4. On the pop-up warning, click "run anyway."
5. Return to the prior browser tab.
6. The Inputs text fields will now become editable. In the text_input box, type a description for the AI to generate images from. Get creative!
7. Select `[ SUBMIT ]`. Note: This may take several minutes before you start to see the images being generated.
8. When the rendering is complete, the .mp4 video will be generated. Right-click to save the video file to disc.
9. Once you have rendered the first sentence, it should be much faster to generate new ones. 

 *Note: This is run using Google Colab's spare computing resources, and will not run quickly or sometimes you need to retry a few times during heavy usage.*

 *Note 2: There are some bugs in the code of Pollinations which result in it becoming desyncronized with Colab. Often one has to go to the Colab tab and click "Runtime -> Factory Reset Runtime", then "Runtime -> Run All" and to be on the save side visit the homepage of [Pollinations.AI](https://pollinations.ai) to get started again. This whole process will become much easier in the near future.*
 
 *Note 3: A bot is posting all the finished Pollinations to Twitter and a few other social networks. Data is stored on the Interplanetary Filesystem. No information about the user is stored. Ideally one should be able to chose not to post something. There should be a button soon.*
