# 01 Executive Summary: Pollinations.AI

## Problem & Solution
Generative AI is transformative, but access for individual Creators is blocked by complex infrastructure and API costs. Pollinations.ai removes this friction: a **one-command SDK** provides Creators with scalable AI media generation (image, text, audio), turnkey hosting via GitHub Pages, and built-in monetization.

## Monetization Model
*   **Default Model (Target Launch Q1 2026):** Pollinations captures 100% of Ad Revenue generated via ads from Ad Providers shown to End-Users in Creator apps. This revenue funds the platform and automatically upgrades the Creator app's operational tier/limits based on its performance (Ad € / Cloud € ratio). **No Creator billing or payouts.**
*   **Optional Models (Target Launch Q2-Q4 2026):** Introduce optional models for Creators: (1) Pay a **Premium Subscription** (GA Q2 2026) for guaranteed tiers/limits (potentially ad-free apps for End-Users). (2) Opt-into a **50/50 share** of Ad Revenue generated by their specific app (GA Q4 2026).

## Market & Traction (March 2025)
We operate in the rapidly growing AI-powered advertising market (~$234B TAM). Our platform empowers Creators to reach millions of End-Users.
*   **3M+ monthly active End-Users**
*   **13,000+ Creators** (Discord community)
*   **100K+ media generations/month**
*   **300+ third-party Creator app integrations**
*   **Current Monetization:** Testing ads; platform revenue projected to reach **~$250K+ ARR run-rate** shortly after full Ad Stack launch via automated tiering system.

## Team
*   **Thomas Haferlach (CEO):** Scaled AI platforms, ex-Amazon, 8+ yrs Generative AI expertise.
*   **Elliot Fouchy (COO):** 20 yrs A/V tech, 6+ yrs AI project management, scaled AI infra.

## Ask
We are raising to launch the ad-funded automatic tiering system (Q1 2026), roll out premium/rev-share options through Q4 2026, and reach break-even by end of 2026.
