## 2 | Benchmarks for API / SDK Monetization

| Platform       | Distribution   | Monetization Model                 | Creator Payout / Share    | Pollinations Comparison Key Lesson                     |
| -------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| GIPHY          | GIF API        | Sponsored/branded GIFs             | None                      | Simple ad integration in media possible.             |
| Unsplash       | Image CDN      | Branded photos / API tiers         | Opt‑in (photographers)    | Native branding viable; Tiered API access common.    |
| Unity Ads      | SDK            | Rewarded, Interstitial, Banner Ads | Creator keeps ≈ 70%       | Industry standard for high Creator ad rev-share.   |
| AppLovin MAX   | SDK + Exchange | Programmatic Video/Playable Ads    | ≥ 70% to Creator          | AI optimization boosts eCPM; high Creator share norm. |
| Google AdSense | JS Tag         | Display & Video Ads                | 68% to Publisher          | Benchmark for payout reliability.                    |
| **Pollinations (Default)** | **SDK / API**  | **Contextual Ads (via Ad Providers)** | **0% (Tier Upgrades instead)** | **Unique: Free tier funded by 100% Ad Rev capture.** |
| **Pollinations (Optional '26+)** | **SDK / API** | **Premium Sub OR Ad Rev-Share** | **€ (Premium) / 50% (Ad Rev)** | **Offers choice aligning with industry payout levels.** |

## 3 | Unity Deep‑Dive (Closest Ad Analogy)

*   **Revenue:** Heavily reliant on Ads (~66% in 2024).
*   **Model:** SDK-based ads (rewarded video etc.) with ~70% payout to Creators.
*   **AI:** Investing in ad optimization (Unity Vector).
*   **Pollinations Contrast:** Pollinations' default model avoids direct payouts, instead funding tier upgrades with 100% ad revenue capture. Optional rev-share (50%, launching 2026) is lower than Unity's standard but provides choice.

---

## 4 | AppLovin Contrast

*   **AI Focus:** Uses AI (Axon 2.0) for campaign optimization.
*   **Model:** Mediation platform maximizing yield for Creators (≥ 70% share).
*   **Pollinations Contrast:** Similar reliance on AI for ad performance, but different default value exchange (tiers vs. cash). Optional 50% share (launching 2026) is less competitive on % but integrated within the AI media platform.

## 5 | Perplexity AI – Native Ad + Premium Precedent

| Ad unit            | ‘Sponsored follow‑up question’ & side media tiles |                               |

**Relevance to Pollinations:**
