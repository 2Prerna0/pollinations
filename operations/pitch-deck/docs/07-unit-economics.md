# 07 Pollinations.AI Unit Economics

This document outlines the core calculations and assumptions driving Pollinations' monetization model, covering the default Ad-Funded Automatic Tiering model and the optional models (Creator Premium Subscription, 50/50 Ad Revenue Share) targeted for launch during 2026.

## Core Assumptions (Baseline Model)

These assumptions primarily drive the default model where Pollinations captures 100% of Ad Revenue to fund automatic tier upgrades for Creator apps, based on current traction (~3M MAU, ~100K+ generations/month).

| Block | Key numbers (Default Model) |
|-------|-----------------------------|
| **End-User Engagement** | 30 conversations / End‑User / mo. |
| **Ad Supply (from Ad Providers)** | 1 paid ad per End-User conversation. |
| **Ad Mix / Pricing (from Ad Providers)** | • Text: 50% · eCPM \$2.50 <br>• Rich: 50% · eCPM \$5.00 <br>• **Blended eCPM \$3.75** |
| **Platform Ad Revenue Share (Default)** | 100% Pollinations. Drives automatic tier upgrades for Creator apps based on Ad € / Cloud € ratio. |
| **Infra Cost / End-User conversation** | \$0.001 (€0.0009 approx.) |
| **End-User Churn ⇒ Lifetime** | 15% / mo ⇒ 6.7 mo. |

## Baseline Unit Economics & Platform LTV (per End-User via Ads)

This calculates the value generated for the Pollinations platform from each End-User under the default ad-funded model.

| Metric (Pollinations Platform, per End-User - Default Model) | Formula | Result |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------|
| Ad Impressions / End-User / mo                            | 30 × 100% | **30** |
| Gross Ad Revenue / End-User / mo                          | 30 × ($3.75/1000) × 1.0 | **$0.1125** (€0.105 approx.) |
| Cost / End-User / mo                                      | 30 × $0.001 | **$0.03** (€0.028 approx.) |
| **Contribution Margin (CM) / End-User / mo**              | Gross Ad Rev − Cost | **$0.0825** (€0.077 approx.) |
| **End‑User LTV (to Pollinations via Ads)**                | CM / mo × 6.7 mo | **$0.55275** (€0.516 approx.) |

**Key Metric: Ad € / Cloud € Ratio**
*   **Definition:** Ratio of Ad Revenue generated by a specific Creator's app to the Cloud Infrastructure Costs incurred by that specific app.
*   **Function (Default Model):** Automatically drives the app's operational tier and limits. Higher ratio = better tiers/limits.
*   **Break-even:** An app (or the platform overall) is self-sustaining when this ratio is ≥ 1.

## Optional Creator Choices - Unit Economics (Illustrative - Launching 2026)

These models run *in parallel* with the default Ad-Funded Tiering model for Creators who choose to opt-in.

| Metric (Optional Creator Choice)        | Who Pays Whom?                     | Amount        | Notes                                                                                   |
|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Creator Chooses Premium Subscription (GA Q2 2026)** |                                    |               |                                                                                         |
| Premium Subscription Fee                | Creator → Pollinations             | e.g., €10/mo  | Pollinations earns direct revenue from Creator. Margin = Fee - Infra Cost.               |
| Ad Revenue Generated                    | Ad Provider → Pollinations         | €0 (usually)  | Ads likely disabled by Creator.                                                         |
| Creator Ad Rev-Share Payout             | Pollinations → Creator             | €0            | Not applicable.                                                                         |
| **Creator Chooses 50/50 Ad Rev-Share (GA Q4 2026)** |                                    |               |                                                                                         |
| Gross Ad Revenue (from Creator's App) | Ad Provider → Pollinations         | Variable (ARPU)| Based on End-User engagement in *that specific app*.                                      |
| Creator Ad Rev-Share Payout             | Pollinations → Creator             | 50% of Gross ARPU | Pollinations pays Creator half the ad revenue their specific app generated.             |
| Platform Margin (per opted-in Creator)  | Pollinations keeps 50% Ad Revenue | 50% of Gross ARPU | Margin = 50% Ad Revenue - Infra Cost for that Creator's app.                             |

**Note:** The overall financial health depends on the mix of Creators choosing each option (Default Tiering, Premium, Ad Rev-Share), the pricing of Premium subscriptions, and the ad performance of apps whose Creators opted for rev-share.
