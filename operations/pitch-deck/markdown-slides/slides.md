## Unity for AI

**The lightning‑fast path from idea ➜ monetized generative‑AI product.**

<!--
SLIDE GUIDANCE:
- Do you think maybe starting the first slide with the name of another company is too early? we should focus on pollinations. or it goes in the speaker notes

# <span class="bg-red-600 text-white p-2 rounded">**😖 Problem**</span>

::left::

### **Creator (Affiliate)**
* Complex AI infrastructure
* Authentication headaches
* No built‑in monetisation

### **End Users (Consumer)**
* Paywalls everywhere
* Privacy concerns
* Limited customisation

### **Ad Providers (Brand)**
* Missing youth demographic
* No AI-native targeting

::right::

<img src="/media/paintpointsgenz.png" alt="Pain Points Visual" class="w-7/8" />

*The current ecosystem forces painful trade-offs.*

<!--
SLIDE GUIDANCE:
- Frame problem as a dual pain point affecting both developers AND users
- Don't forget the AD providers. They are not reaching the indie creator apps. The money comes from there so they may be more important than the others in terms of priority/ or same importance
- The problem statement is clear - but could potentially add 1-2 concrete examples of developer/user friction
- Consider mentioning competition implicitly (without naming) by referencing their limitations (check context/parallels-unity-for-ai-and-others.md for more detail)

# <span class="bg-green-600 text-white p-2 rounded">✨ The Pollinations Fix: **AI App Factory**</span>

::left::

*   **AI Sets Up:** Launch instantly via assistant.
*   **You Focus on Frontend:** Build the UI/UX.
*   **Plug & Play AI:** Simple URLs for media features.
*   **Backend Handled:** We run infra, scale, & ads.

*The easiest path to a live, monetized AI app.*

::right::

<img src="/media/pollinations_fix_genz.png" alt="Pollinations Fix Diagram" class="w-mx mx-auto mt-4" />

<!--
SLIDE GUIDANCE:
- Synthesized from Alt 2 & 3.
- Kept "AI App Factory" (Alt 3).
- Used "AI Sets Up" (Alt 2/3) + "Launch instantly" (Alt 3 speed).
- Used "You Focus on Frontend" (Alt 2 developer role).
- Improved "Plug-in AI" to "Plug & Play AI" + "Simple URLs".
- Used "Backend Handled" (Alt 2 clarity) + "infra, scale & ads" (Alt 2/3 specifics).
- Kept strong tagline (Alt 3).
-->

<!-- SPEAKER NOTES:
- Developers use their AI coding assistant (integrated with our tools) to bootstrap projects from various starter kits (React, Unity, etc.), automating repo creation, config, and deployment.
- This frees the developer to concentrate *only* on building the user-facing application.
- Adding generative AI (image, text, audio) requires just simple HTTPS calls to our Edge APIs.
- Pollinations manages the entire backend: scalable hosting (e.g., GitHub Pages), CI/CD, model serving, security, auth, usage metering, and the monetization layer (serving ads, managing rev-share payouts). Zero server ops for the dev.

# <span class="bg-purple-600 text-white p-2 rounded">**🌍 Market & Business Model**</span>

::left::

<img src="/media/youth-ad-market.png" alt="Youth Ad Market" class="w-3/4 mx-auto my-4" />

💰 Generative AI creator economy **$10 B** TAM 📈 Generative AI market doubling YoY (Gartner 2025)

::right::

## Two-Sided Market 🔄

* **Unity for AI**: 50% revenue share to Creators, proven model
* **Brands → Young Creators → End-Users**
* Users get free AI experiences, brands reach youth demographic

## Revenue Streams 💰

1. Contextual ads (CPM \$1–2) - *PoC Live*
2. 50% app rev‑share (Roblox style) - *Pilot Live*


<!--
SLIDE GUIDANCE:
In Pollinations.AI’s ecosystem, the core two sides are:
* **Affiliates (Creators):** developers and hobbyists who embed generative-AI media (with referral links) into their apps ~[Tipalti](https://tipalti.com/en-uk/affiliate-hub/affiliate-network/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)~
* **Advertisers (Brands):** companies supplying those referral links and paying for conversions 

**End-user:** Consumer
**Creator:** Affiliate
**Brand:** Advertiser
**Us:** Platform

- Exploring extra revenue stream (TBC from Q2 2026)
   1. Micro‑purchases (stickers, tokens)
   2. Premium tiers (SLA, bigger models)
   3. Data monetisation (e.g. user data for training)
- Untapped / Developping market
- Potential positioning options from parallels doc: "GIPHY-meets-AdSense for AI", "Unsplash for AI—monetised out-of-the-box"
- Unity, AppLovin, and other platforms demonstrate lightweight SDKs with embedded ads are proven high-margin models
- Consider adding slide on how we're better/differently positioned than Unity/AppLovin for AI era (AI-native, better targeting)

# <span class="bg-yellow-600 text-white p-2 rounded">📈 **GTM Flywheel & Moat**</span>

* **Trust Moat:** 📖 Open source (MIT) & Privacy-first approach
* **Market Trend:** 📊 4× More citizen Creators than pros (Gartner)
* **Tech Advantage:** 🧠 Native AI-powered ad targeting (like AppLovin's Axon 2.0)
* **Network Effect:** 🔄 More apps → Better data → Better platform → More apps

<!--
SLIDE GUIDANCE:
- Unity generates $1.2B (66%) from ads via lightweight SDK with rev-share - directly parallel to our model
- potentially the best slide to add competition
- one of our principle moats is that devs are embedding us in their open source repositories, making youtube videos, and spreading the word organically. discord bots in many guilds...
- Consider adding from parallels doc: "Anyone who can type a prompt is a potential Pollinations integrator" (maybe previous slide)
- Consider adding IDC forecast: 750M new cloud-native apps by 2026 - huge TAM expansion (previous slide?)
- Ad unit options to consider highlighting: native widgets, brand overlays, performance link ads
