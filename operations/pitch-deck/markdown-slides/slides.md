# **Advertisers & Ad Tech: Untapped AI Frontier**

### 🍀 Fragmented & Unique Inventory
#
### 📊 Low Engagement with Generic Ads

<!--
## Problem - Two Sides of the Same Coin

**For Indie/Vibe Coders:**
* These devs face a real **monetization blindspot** - traditional ads just **don't work** in AI interactions
* They lack **specialized tools** to integrate ads naturally into their **generative content**
* Result? Amazing apps with **no sustainable business model**

**For Advertisers & Ad Tech:**
* They're struggling to reach these valuable **AI-native audiences** effectively
* The inventory is incredibly **fragmented** - thousands of diverse AI apps with **no unified access**
* Their standard banner ads completely **miss the mark** in these rich AI experiences

**Key Takeaway:** This gap is exactly what **Pollinations solves** - connecting both sides of this AI-native ecosystem.

## Solution - Connecting Creation with Monetization

**Our Core Value Proposition:**
* We take creators from **idea to income** with **zero upfront cost** - this is crucial
* Look at this flow diagram - it shows exactly how we **connect all the pieces**

**For Indie/Vibe Coders:**
* We make **AI integration effortless** while providing a **clear path to profit**
* Their apps can actually **self-fund** their own compute costs - game changer!
* And in 2026, we'll launch **Nectar** with **50/50 revenue sharing** for top performers

**For Advertisers:**
* We're opening access to these previously **untapped AI-native audiences**
* Our **context-aware dynamic ad placements** fit naturally in AI experiences
* This drives **much higher engagement** than traditional ad formats

**In short:** We build the **infrastructure**, partner with **ad experts**, and **everyone shares** in the success

## From Prompt to Profit - Our 3-Step Creator Journey
* Let me walk you through our clear **3-step journey** for creators
* Step 1 - **Seed** (Live Today): We provide completely **free tools** and **ad-supported compute** through our partners
* This **removes all barriers** to entry and helps creators get started immediately
* Step 2 - **Flower** (H2 '25): Apps begin to **self-fund** their own compute costs through ad revenue
* At this stage, Pollinations earns **platform revenue** from our partners, and creators get **better models** and **higher limits**
* Step 3 - **Nectar** (H2 '26): For top-performing apps, we introduce a **50/50 net ad revenue share** from our partner revenue
* To put this in perspective: With 1M MAU and a $1.50 CPM, that's about **$13.5K net monthly revenue**, with **$6.75K going directly** to the developer
* This creates a **sustainable ecosystem** where **everyone wins** - creators, advertisers, and Pollinations
