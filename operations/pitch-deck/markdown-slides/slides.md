# <span class="bg-red-600 text-white p-2 rounded">**😖 Problem**</span>

::left::

### App Creator
- Generative AI APIs are pay‑walled and DevOps‑heavy
- Solo devs and indie studios struggle to experiment or scale
- No built-in monetization

![Problem: Friction](/media/problem_friction.png)

::right::

### Advertiser
- Struggling to reach engaged audiences in new AI spaces

![Problem: Reach](/media/problem_reach.png)

<div class="text-center" style="font-size: 24px;">
The current ecosystem forces <b>painful trade-offs</b>.
</div>

<!--
**Speaking Points - Problem:**
* **Creator & Developer Pain Points:**
  * Complex and expensive AI infrastructure
  * Critical gap: No clear monetization path for successful apps

* **Ad Provider/Brand Pain Points:**

  * Missing youth demographic - particularly Gen Z
  * No AI-native targeting mechanisms

* **Core Market Problem:** System friction prevents an open ecosystem where developers can earn from success (make this into a short phrase that covers both creators and advertisers - the message to take away from this slide)

## The Pollinations Flywheel 🚀
* **Empowering Creators ('Vibe Coders')** : Build & monetize innovative AI apps, easily.
* **Attracting Advertisers (Brands)** : Reach engaged audiences in unique AI contexts.

## How do we make money? 🔄
* Enables indie creators to build, deploy, & monetize AI apps, targeting a multi-billion dollar AI-contextual advertising market.

<div v-click="1">
* **Revenue Model:** 50/50 ad revenue share with developers
</div>

<div v-click="2">
* **Unit Economics:** 1M MAU → 10M Ad Impressions → $15K Revenue → $7.5K to Developers
</div>

<div v-click="3">
* **Live Pilots:** Contextual ads (CPM $1-2), Affiliate referrals
</div>

<!--
* **Creator Economy Trend:** Rise of 'vibe coding' expands the creator pool.
* **New Ad Inventory:** Unlocking new advertising inventory within millions of new AI apps.
* **GenAI Market Size:** Overall GenAI creator economy already >$10 Billion TAM and doubling.

* **Two-Sided Market Model:**
  * **Creators (Affiliates):** Growing wave of developers and 'vibe coders' using our free AI APIs
  * **Advertisers (Brands):** Reaching engaged audiences in novel AI-native experiences
  * **Target Audience:** Youth/Gen Z are strong early adopters, but the audience is broad

* **Revenue Model:** Simple, proven model like Unity Ads, built for this new wave of AI creation
* **Revenue Sharing:** 50% ad revenue share goes directly back to creators - we enable, they build, everyone earns
* **Current Revenue Streams:** Contextual ads & Affiliate referrals pilots are live (as shown on slide)

* **Economic Advantages:**
  * Cost per AI media generation is dropping each year
  * Ad revenue potential per interaction remains strong
  * Unit economics improve over time, making our free, ad-supported model increasingly sustainable

* **Risk Management:** Tiered validation system ensures ad quality and manages free tier costs

SLIDE GUIDANCE:

In Pollinations.AI's ecosystem, the core two sides are:
* **Affiliates (Creators):** developers and hobbyists who embed generative-AI media (with referral links) into their apps
* **Advertisers (Brands):** companies supplying those referral links and paying for conversions

**End-user:** Consumer
**Creator:** Affiliate
**Brand:** Advertiser
**Us:** Platform

- Exploring extra revenue stream (TBC from Q2 2026)
   1. Micro‑purchases (stickers, tokens)
   2. Premium tiers (SLA, bigger models)
   3. Data monetization (e.g. user data for training)
- Potential positioning options from parallels doc: "GIPHY-meets-AdSense for AI", "Unsplash for AI—monetized out-of-the-box"
- Unity, AppLovin, and other platforms demonstrate lightweight SDKs with embedded ads are proven high-margin models
- Consider adding slide on how we're better/differently positioned than Unity/AppLovin for AI era (AI-native, better targeting)

# <span class="bg-yellow-600 text-white p-2 rounded">🛡️ **Competitive Moat**</span>

::left::
## Unfair Advantages

* **Two-sided network effects:** More apps → better targeting → more revenue
* **Open source trust moat:** Developer community embedding our code
* **Unique inventory:** Monetizing contexts no other ad network can reach
* **Distribution strategy:** Free access drives viral adoption

::right::
## Competitive Differentiation

<div v-click="1">
**vs AI Model Providers** (OpenAI, HuggingFace):
Free access AND built-in revenue path
</div>

<div v-click="2">
**vs Game Monetizers** (Unity Ads):
AI creation engine AND monetization layer
</div>

<div v-click="3">
**vs Ad-Supported AI Products** (Perplexity):
Empower third-party developers with revenue sharing
</div>

<!--
**Speaking Points - Competitive Moat:**
* **Business Model Advantage:** Our model creates a circular economy, a flywheel for growth.

![Fly Wheel](../media/fly-wheel-genz.png)

* Circular diagram showing the flywheel effect:
* More apps lead to more users, leading to better data, better targeting, more revenue, better platform, and back to more apps.
* Illustrates the self-reinforcing nature of the business model.

* **Market Tailwind:** The GenAI market is doubling year-over-year.
* **Data Advantage:** Better usage data unlocks smarter ad targeting, increasing revenue.
* **Trust Factor:** Open Source & Privacy-First approach builds developer trust.

* **Key Competitive Differentiators (as on slide):**
  * **vs AI Model Providers (OpenAI, Hugging Face):** We offer free access AND a built-in revenue path.
  * **vs Game Monetizers (Unity Ads):** We are the AI creation engine AND the monetization layer for all app types.
  * **vs Ad-Supported AI Products (Perplexity):** We empower third-party developers with shared revenue, not just monetize our own app.

* **Core Advantage:** Our unique Free API + Shared Ad Revenue model is our fundamental differentiator.
* **Proven Model:** Unity has proven the underlying ad/rev-share model generates billions.

SLIDE GUIDANCE:
- Market trend: 4× More citizen Creators than pros.
- Unity generates $1.2B (66%) from ads via lightweight SDK with rev-share - directly parallel to our model.
- One of our principle moats: developers embedding us in their open source repositories, making YouTube videos, and spreading the word organically (e.g., Discord bots in many guilds).
- Consider adding from parallels doc: "Anyone who can type a prompt is a potential Pollinations integrator" (maybe previous slide).
- Consider adding IDC forecast: 750M new cloud-native apps by 2026 - huge TAM expansion (previous slide?).
- Ad unit options to consider highlighting: native widgets, brand overlays, performance link ads.
