## The Pollinations Flywheel 🚀
* **Empowering Creators ('Vibe Coders')** : Build & monetize innovative AI apps, easily.
* **Attracting Advertisers (Brands)** : Reach engaged audiences in unique AI contexts.

## How do we make money? 🔄
* Enables indie creators to build, deploy, & monetize AI apps, targeting a multi-billion dollar AI-contextual advertising market.

<div v-click="1">
* **Revenue Model:** 50/50 ad revenue share with developers
</div>

<div v-click="2">
* **Unit Economics:** 1M MAU → 10M Ad Impressions → $15K Revenue → $7.5K to Developers
</div>

<div v-click="3">
* **Live Pilots:** Contextual ads (CPM $1-2), Affiliate referrals
</div>



We make building and monetizing AI apps frictionless and economically viable for creators, while providing brands with novel, effective channels to reach valuable audiences. This creates a self-reinforcing flywheel, fueling the growth of the entire AI creator ecosystem.

1 Free Experimentation (Explorer → Creator): Easy entry and free tools attract a wide developer base, acting as an investment in future monetizable applications. (Ongoing)
2 Ad-Funded Scaling (Creator → Innovator): Successful apps integrate ads, cover their costs, and unlock unlimited usage, SOTA models, and enhanced visibility through the Marketplace, driving app discovery. (H2 2025)
3 Revenue Partnership (Innovator → Partner): Top Innovators share 50/50 in net ad revenue, turning projects into businesses and showcasing platform success. (H2 2026)

* **Economic Advantages:**
  * Cost per AI media generation is dropping each year
  * Ad revenue potential per interaction remains strong
  * Unit economics improve over time, making our free, ad-supported model increasingly sustainable

**End-user:** Consumer
**Creator:** Affiliate
**Brand:** Advertiser
**Us:** Platform

note: this flywheel description may be better than the one we have on the slide. find a nice way to separate it between slide and speaker notes.
Flywheel: By solving these dual problems, pollinations.ai creates a virtuous cycle: More developers build innovative apps on our free platform -> This attracts more end-users -> This creates more valuable, AI-native ad inventory -> This attracts brands and ad revenue -> A portion of this revenue is shared back with successful developers, incentivizing further creation and platform growth, while also funding the free tier for new entrants.
