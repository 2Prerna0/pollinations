# üîç **Due Diligence**
#
## ü§î **Problem Statement** What pain/problem are you solving?
#
### **For Creators** (Developers, Indie Studios)
- Generative AI APIs are often paywalled and require significant DevOps effort.
- Infrastructure complexity and scaling challenges.
- Solo developers and indie studios struggle to experiment, scale applications, and find clear paths to monetization.
#
### **For Ad Providers** (Brands, Ad Networks)
- Difficulty accessing and engaging audiences within emerging AI-native applications.
- Missed opportunities for contextual advertising in these new digital spaces.

<br>

## üí° **Solution** : How are you solving it?
#
#### **Pollinations.ai provides the ad-funded backend for generative AI:**

- **Single SDK Integration**: Gives developers:
  - Free, cloud-scaled media generation (handling backend complexity).
  - Turnkey ad slot integrated into their application.

- **Automated Scaling**: Ad revenue covers AI compute costs (GPU time), allowing apps to graduate to higher tiers with unlimited usage based on the `Ad ‚Ç¨ / Cloud ‚Ç¨` ratio.

- **Path to Income**: The **Partner Tier** (launching H2 2026) offers a **50/50 split of *net* ad revenue**, providing a direct path from idea to income.

- **For Ad Providers**: We aggregate a network of unique AI applications, offering scalable access to engaged users.

- **Zero-UI / Zero-Ops**: A single CLI command (`pollinations-init`) automates repository setup, CI/CD, and deployment.

<br>

## üéØ **Customer Persona** - Who is the recipient of your solution?
