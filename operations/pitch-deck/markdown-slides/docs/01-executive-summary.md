| **Problem**        | Generative AI APIs are pay‑walled and DevOps‑heavy; solo devs and indie studios struggle to experiment or scale.                                                            |
| **Solution**       | An ad‑supported model: High‑rate, no‑auth API to start; ads inside end‑apps finance GPU time automatically, unlocking higher tiers.                                |
| **Go‑to‑Market**   | **4‑tier ladder:** Explorer → Creator → Innovator → **Partner**. pollinations.ai retains 100% ad revenue until **H2 2026**, when **Partner** tier begins a 50/50 split.             |
| **Traction**       | **300+** Explorer apps • Creator Beta Launched: Q2 2025 • **100M+** media/month rendered at **≤ €0.0005 per media unit**. • **13K+** Discord community members. • **Ecosystem:** ~3M MAU (total estimated across 300+ apps), 100M+ media/month. High-profile integrations (e.g., on Roblox 500k MAU).                 |
| **Roadmap**        | Innovator GA **Q3 2025** (Unlimited usage, SOTA models, rich ads) → **Partner** GA **H2 2026** (50/50 revenue share).                                                            |
| **Business Model** | Today: Ad impressions drive platform revenue. From **H2 2026:** Share 50% of Net Ad Revenue with **Partner** tier to accelerate ecosystem growth.                         |
| **Unit Economics** | Target **~58% gross margin** (on net retained revenue) with **Partner** tier active. Break‑even ad fill eCPM for platform ≈ **€1.20 (gross)** on a per-app basis.                |
| **Team**           | Founders with proven AI platform execution: Scaled core tech to 100M+ monthly requests; experienced in AI product lifecycle management. Lean, 5-person Berlin or remote core planned. |
| **Fundraise**      | Seeking **€3M Seed**. Use of Funds: ~40% GPU & Infrastructure, ~30% R&D/Product (Innovator/Partner tech), ~20% Team Expansion, ~10% GTM & Community (incl. first Partner cohort onboarding). |
