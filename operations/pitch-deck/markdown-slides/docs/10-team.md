## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **TEAM**

### CEO | Thomas Haferlach

* **Owns the long-range vision and technical roadmap,** steering Pollinations toward the next major inflection in generative-AI infrastructure.
* **Leads internal model research and rapid SOTA experiments,** keeping the stack ahead of the market.
* **Designs and codes the end-to-end architecture**—from edge inference services to SDK tooling—behind our "zero-ops" promise.

### COO | Elliot Fouchy

* **Runs day-to-day engineering and ops**—sprints, deployments, incident response—while continually refining processes, dashboards and OKRs to keep 100 M+ renders / month reliable and cost-efficient.
* **Manages resources, vendor contracts, cost levers and strategic partnerships**—GPU / cloud capacity, ad-tech integrations and research collaborations—so spend and alliances stay tightly aligned with roadmap priorities.
* **Jumps into code as needed**—automation scripts, IaC, growth experiments—to unblock teams and accelerate delivery.

### CBO | *Hiring*

*Business architect who turns Pollinations.ai's fly-wheel traction into a resilient, investor-ready company.*

* **Chart and execute the fundraising roadmap,** owning the story and closing the next Seed round and beyond.
* **Build rigorous financial discipline**—budgets, KPI dashboards and unit-economics models that safeguard net margins as usage scales.
* **Establish legal & governance foundations**—entity structure, IP strategy, data-privacy / ad-tech compliance, and the contracts powering rev-share and subscription plans.
* **Design hiring plans, equity frameworks and culture rituals** that attract and retain top talent through rapid growth.
* **Own risk management and operational scalability,** embedding processes and tooling that de-risk market, technical and regulatory exposure across all roadmap phases.
