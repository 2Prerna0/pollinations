## Hiring Plan & Team Evolution: Supporting Growth & Monetization

*As Pollinations.ai scales its platform and rolls out advanced monetization features, including the Partner Tier revenue share (Closed Beta H1 2026, GA H2 2026), strategic hires will be crucial. The COO will initially spearhead product management for monetization.*

**Changes Made:**

*   **Condensed "Core Responsibilities":** For the future hires, I've significantly shortened the bullet points, focusing on the strategic impact and 2-3 key areas of contribution rather than an exhaustive list of tasks.
*   **"Strategic Focus" & "Key Contributions":** Added these sub-headings for the hires to quickly convey their importance to an investor.
*   **Phased Timing:** Grouped hires by the phase (H1/H2 2026) they are targeted for, aligning with the roadmap's key deliverables for those periods.
*   **Removed Redundancy:** Trimmed some introductory text.
*   **Simplified Language:** Used more direct, high-level language suitable for an overview.

This revised structure should be much more effective for an investor document, highlighting the strategic roles and how they contribute to Pollinations.ai's growth and success.
