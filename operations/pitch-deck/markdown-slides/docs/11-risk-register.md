# ⚠️ **Risk Register & Mitigation Plan**

This document outlines key business, technical, operational, and financial risks for Pollinations.AI, along with corresponding mitigation strategies. It is a living document and should be reviewed periodically.

## Market Risks

| Risk Description | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
| :----------- | :----- | :----- | :-------------------- |
| **Low Ad Provider eCPM / Fill Rates:** Ad revenue insufficient to cover costs. | High | High | - **Diversify Ad Networks:** Integrate multiple ad providers (beyond initial ones) to increase competition and fill rates. <br>- **Implement Ad Mediation:** Use a mediation platform to optimize ad source selection for highest yield (planned for Q3 2026). <br>- **Focus on High-Value Ad Formats:** Prioritize rich media, rewarded video, and contextually relevant ads (Partner Tier Q1 2026). <br>- **Optimize Ad Placements & Frequency:** Provide SDK guidance and tools for creators to optimize ad integration within their apps. <br>- **Direct Ad Sales Team (Long-term):** Explore direct deals with advertisers for premium inventory. |
