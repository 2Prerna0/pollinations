# üî≠ **Vision & Mission**

## üöÄ Mission

To build the dominant AI creation and distribution platform where Creator apps that fund themselves through Ad Provider revenue (via End-User engagement) are automatically upgraded‚Äîno billing or payouts required for Creators in the default model‚Äîempowering them to build and share AI experiences at scale, while offering flexible options (launching 2026) like Premium Subscriptions and Ad Revenue Sharing for Creators seeking different value propositions.

## üåü Vision (Evolving through 2026)

### Universal AI Development
Make AI creation accessible to every Creator through democratized development and the vibe coding revolution.

### Interface-Free Creation
Build a development platform for Creators entirely without traditional visual interfaces (Zero-UI).

### Flexible Monetization for Creators
Offer cutting-edge AI capabilities:
*   **Default Model (Ad-Funded Tiering):** Funded by Ad Revenue (from Ad Providers via End-User engagement), directly fueling higher operational tiers/limits for Creator apps automatically.
*   **Optional Models (Rolling out 2026):** Creators can choose: continue with ad-funded tiering, pay a Premium Subscription for guaranteed tiers/ad-removal, OR opt-in to a 50/50 share of their app's Ad Revenue.

### Creator Economy Engine
Empower Creators ("vibe coders") with tools and choices: benefit from automatic tier upgrades via ads OR select Premium/Ad Rev-Share models (available 2026). This fosters self-sustaining app growth and Creator success on their own terms.
