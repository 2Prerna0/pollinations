# üí∞ **Business Model**

## The Challenge: A Disconnected AI Ecosystem Stifling Creators & Brands

*   **Creators & Developers (Supply):** Face prohibitive AI access costs, infrastructure complexity, and no clear path to monetize their innovative AI apps. Many groundbreaking ideas remain unsustainable.
*   **Ad Providers & Brands (Demand):** Struggle to reach engaged, often younger, audiences within new AI-native applications. They miss out on unique contextual advertising opportunities in these emerging digital spaces.

## Our Solution: The Ad-Funded Bridge

Pollinations.AI is the **ad-funded backend and marketplace** connecting AI creators with brands, turning innovative AI apps into sustainable businesses.

    *   **Automated, Ad-Funded Scaling:** Our SDK integrates contextual ads. Revenue first covers the app's AI compute costs, enabling free scaling based on user engagement.
    *   **Shared Success:** Our **Partner Tier (H2 2026)** offers a **50/50 net ad-revenue split**, creating a direct path from idea to income.

2.  **For Brands: Access to Engaged, AI-Native Audiences**

## 3. App Segmentation & Tier Ladder

## 4. Revenue Streams

1.  **Advertising Revenue (Platform Retained):**
    *   During **Phase 1 (H2 2025)** and **Phase 2 (H1 2026)**, all ad income generated through the Pollinations SDK (v1 & v2) flows to Pollinations to cover platform costs and fund growth.
2.  **Shared Advertising Revenue (Partner Tier):**
