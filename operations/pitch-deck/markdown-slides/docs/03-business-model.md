# 💰 **Business Model**

## 1. Value Proposition

Pollinations.AI turns cutting‑edge multimodal AI models into **plug‑and‑play APIs** backed by a simple, ad‑supported monetisation engine. We remove the friction of scaling inference and earning revenue—so creators can focus on building apps, games, and experiences.

## 2. Stakeholders

* **Creators** – Developers and small teams building applications on the Pollinations platform.
* **End‑Users** – People interacting with those applications.
* **Ad Providers** – Ad networks (e.g., Google AdSense) supplying inventory and paying for impressions/clicks.
* **Pollinations** – The platform operator orchestrating models, infrastructure, and ads.

## 3. Customer Segmentation & Tier Ladder

| Tier | Name          | Primary User                  | Key Benefits                                    | Planned Availability |
| ---- | ------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| 1    | **Explorer**  | Curious devs, hobbyists       | High rate limits, no auth, zero cost            | Production (live)    |
| 2    | **Creator**   | Early‑stage projects          | Auth token, moderate limits, usage analytics    | Beta (Q2 2025)       |
| 3    | **Innovator** | Profitable apps               | Unlimited usage, real‑time cost dashboard       | Q3 2025              |
| 4    | **Partner**   | Ad‑integrated profitable apps | SOTA models, rich ad formats, marketplace promo | Q1 2026              |
| 5    | **Associate** | Strategic rev‑share partners  | All Partner perks + **50/50 ad‑revenue split**  | Q4 2026              |

## 4. Revenue Streams

1. **Advertising Revenue (100 %)** – All ad income generated through the Pollinations SDK flows to the platform today.
2. **Future Revenue Share** – Starting Q4 2026, Associate apps will automatically receive **50 % of the ad revenue** they generate.

## 5. Key Differentiator

A default, **zero‑friction ad‑funded path** lets any developer go from idea to profit without credit‑cards or complex pricing. The optional revenue‑share path (Associate tier) rewards top partners while keeping onboarding effortless.

## 6. Cost Structure

* GPU/TPU inference (≈ 80 % of COGS)
* Storage & CDN egress
* Ad‑network fees (\~15 % of ad gross)
* R\&D + Community programmes (hackathons, docs)

## 7. Pricing & Tier Progression

* Public **Pricing Page** compares tiers and explains benefits.
* **ROI Dashboard** (Creator tier +) surfaces real‑time cost vs ad revenue.
* **Automatic Tier Unlock** – when an app’s ad revenue exceeds its compute cost for 30 consecutive days, it qualifies for the Innovator tier and beyond.

## 8. Incentive Framework

| Mechanism                 | What It Does                                        | Applies To          |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **ROI Dashboard**         | Shows cost, ad revenue, and net margin in real time | Creator tier & up   |
| **Marketplace Promotion** | Higher‑tier apps featured more prominently          | Partner / Associate |

## 9. Growth Flywheel

1. **Explorer → Creator** via frictionless docs & SDK samples.
2. **Creator → Innovator** prompted by clear profitability insights in the ROI Dashboard.
3. **Innovator → Partner/Associate** unlocked by ad integration and (from Q4 2026) shared revenue, plus prominent marketplace placement.
