# üí∞ **Business Model**

## 1. Value Proposition

Pollinations.AI turns cutting‚Äëedge multimodal AI models into **plug‚Äëand‚Äëplay APIs** backed by a simple, ad‚Äësupported monetisation engine. We remove the friction of scaling inference and earning revenue‚Äîso creators can focus on building apps, games, and experiences.

## 2. Stakeholders

*   **Creators (Supply)** ‚Äì Developers and small teams building applications on the Pollinations platform.
*   **Ad Providers (Demand)** ‚Äì Ad networks (e.g., Google AdSense) supplying inventory and paying for impressions/clicks.
*   **End‚ÄëUsers** ‚Äì People interacting with those applications.
*   **Pollinations** ‚Äì The platform operator orchestrating models, infrastructure, and ads.

## 4. Revenue Streams

1.  **Advertising Revenue (Platform Retained):**
