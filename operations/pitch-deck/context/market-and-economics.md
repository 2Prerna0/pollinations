# ðŸ“Š Pollinations.AI â€“ Market Sizing & Unit Economics

## Slide 1: Market Sizing (TAM, SAM, SOM)

| Metric         | Estimate    | Assumption / Notes |
|----------------|-------------|---------------------|
| **TAM**        | $234B       | Global AI-contextual ad spend (2025, industry reports) |
| **SAM**        | $140B       | 60% of TAM = indie web + in-app inventory |
| **Beachhead**  | $3.4B       | Generative-AI ads subsegment (~25% YoY growth) |
| **SOM (Now)**  | $1M ARR     | Based on current monetization (~15M MAU) |
| **SOM (Goal)** | $70M ARR    | 0.05% of SAM by 2027 |

> **Approach**: Start from total market (TAM), apply indie share (SAM), focus on Gen-AI segment as beachhead. Use current ARR to estimate SOM and growth trajectory.

## Slide 2: Unit Economics, LTV & CAC

### 1. Unit Economics

| Metric            | Estimate         | Assumptions |
|-------------------|------------------|-------------|
| **ARPU (base)**   | $0.0288/year     | 10 interactions/user/month Ã— 10% ad trigger Ã— $4 eCPM Ã— 60% fill Ã— 50% platform share |
| **COGS**          | $0.0004/month    | Infra cost < $0.002 CPM |
| **Contribution Margin** | $0.002/month | ARPU â€“ COGS |
| **ARPU (upside)** | $0.45â€“$0.50/year | With 30 interactions/month + 2 rewarded videos at $10 eCPM |

### 2. LTV (Lifetime Value)

| Metric         | Estimate  | Assumptions |
|----------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Churn Rate** | 15%/month | User lifetime â‰ˆ 6.7 months |
| **LTV (base)** | $0.16     | CM Ã— 6.7 months |
| **LTV (upside)**| $1.20    | With ARPU uplift and similar retention |

### 3. Developer (Coder) Economics

| Metric            | Estimate   | Assumptions |
|-------------------|------------|-------------|
| **Coder MAU**     | 150K       | Users per active developer |
| **Coder LTV**     | $8.6K      | 150K MAU Ã— $0.16 LTV Ã— 24-month app life |
| **Coder LTV (upside)** | > $100K | With higher engagement and monetization |

### 4. CAC (Cost to Acquire Developer)

| Metric               | Estimate | Assumptions |
|----------------------|----------|-------------|
| **Acquisition Budget** | $60K/year | Discord/Twitter ads + hackathons |
| **Activation Rate**    | 10%       | From 800 signups â†’ 80 active/payout coders |
| **CAC**                | $750      | $60K Ã· 80 developers |
| **Acceptable CAC ceiling** | $4.3K | LTV Ã· 3 â€” target is well below |

### 5. Ad-Serving Model Assumptions

| Metric                  | Estimate        | Notes |
|-------------------------|-----------------|-------|
| **Trigger Rate**        | 10%             | Ad shown in 1 of 10 user interactions |
| **Monthly Interactions**| 10/user         | Base engagement level |
| **Impressions/Month**   | 12M             | 12M MAU Ã— 10 Ã— 10% |
| **Revenue/Impression**  | ~$0.0012        | $4 eCPM Ã— 60% fill Ã— 50% platform share |

## ðŸ’¡ Notes

- **Pollinations.AI keeps 50% of ad revenue**, with the other 50% paid to the app developer.
- **End users are not compensated**, but generate value through contextual engagement.
- **Costs are minimal at scale** due to lightweight infra and non-intrusive ads.
- **Scalability is built in**: monetization grows with usage, not capped by user count.

## ðŸ“˜ Explanation of Each Value

### Market Sizing

- **TAM (Total Addressable Market)**: The full global spend on AI-contextual ads across all platforms in 2025. Represents the theoretical upper limit of the market.
- **SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market)**: The portion of TAM that applies to indie apps and web platforms, where Pollinations.AI operates (~60% of TAM).
- **Beachhead**: A fast-growing segment of SAM where generative AI creates or personalizes ads â€” the most relevant and high-potential area to focus on first.
- **SOM (Now)**: The actual market share currently captured by Pollinations.AI (~$1M ARR).
- **SOM (Goal)**: Target market share by 2027, based on reasonable traction and platform scaling.

### Unit Economics

- **ARPU (base)**: Average revenue per user per year based on minimal usage (10 events/mo, 10% ad trigger).
- **COGS**: Cost of goods sold per user â€” mostly ad infrastructure and cloud compute to serve impressions.
- **Contribution Margin**: Profit per user after subtracting direct costs â€” shows how scalable and profitable the business can be.
- **ARPU (upside)**: Estimated revenue if users engage more and trigger additional, higher-value ad formats like rewarded video.

### LTV (Lifetime Value)

- **Churn Rate**: The percentage of users who stop using the service each month â€” used to calculate average user lifetime.
- **LTV (base)**: The lifetime value of a user at baseline ARPU and average lifetime.
- **LTV (upside)**: Expected LTV with higher engagement and ad-trigger rate.

### Developer (Coder) Economics

- **Coder MAU**: The average number of monthly active users associated with one developer integrating the Pollinations.AI SDK/API.
- **Coder LTV**: The total value generated by one developer over a 24-month period, based on user LTV and MAU per coder.
- **Coder LTV (upside)**: Increased value if ARPU and engagement improve significantly.

### CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)

- **Acquisition Budget**: The total spend on developer acquisition efforts like hackathons and social ads.
- **Activation Rate**: The percentage of dev signups that become active payout-eligible coders.
- **CAC**: The cost to acquire one developer who successfully integrates and monetizes with the platform.
- **Acceptable CAC ceiling**: A benchmark derived from LTV Ã· 3 â€” CAC should ideally stay below this to maintain profitability.

### Ad-Serving Model Assumptions

- **Trigger Rate**: The probability of showing an ad when a user interacts with the app â€” context-aware, set at 10%.
- **Monthly Interactions**: The average number of interactions per user per month that can trigger ads.
- **Impressions/Month**: The resulting monthly ad impressions across all users (interactions Ã— trigger rate).
- **Revenue/Impression**: The net revenue earned per impression shown, after fill rate and platform/developer split.
