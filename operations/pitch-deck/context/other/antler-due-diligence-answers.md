## Due Diligence Q&A

**Problem Statement (what pain/problem are you solving):**

* Building with AI is complex and expensive for creators, involving infrastructure headaches, authentication issues, and no easy way to monetize viral applications.
* End users face paywalls, have privacy concerns, and desire more customization in AI experiences.
* Ad providers and brands struggle to reach the youth/Gen Z demographic within AI-native applications.
* The current ecosystem forces painful trade-offs due to friction and silos, preventing an open, creative, and monetizable AI ecosystem.

**Solution (how are you solving it):**

> 2 sided market, ad prodiver missing

* Pollinations.ai provides an "AI App Factory," described as "Unity for AI," which simplifies the process of building and monetizing generative AI products.
* The platform offers an end-to-end AI setup with instant integration and auto-configured infrastructure, allowing creators to focus solely on the frontend UI/UX.
* It provides "Plug & Play AI" through simple URL calls for text, image, and audio features.
* Pollinations.ai handles the backend infrastructure, scaling, ads, and revenue sharing.
* The mission is to build the dominant AI creation and distribution platform, empowering developers ("vibe coders") to build, share, and monetize AI experiences at scale. This is fueled by connecting advertisers to a massive and highly engaged global youth audience.
* The vision includes universal AI development (making AI creation accessible to everyone), interface-free creation (a development platform without traditional visual interfaces), and ad-supported state-of-the-art (SOTA) tools to remove cost barriers.

**Customer Persona (who is the recipient of your solution):**

> address this: vibe coder = indie developers of all ages
> end user is of all age, not only youth
> ad provider will reach all end user

* **Creators (Affiliates/Developers/Vibe Coders):** Developers, hobbyists, indie developers, and a new generation of young developers ("vibe coders") who want to build, share, and monetize AI applications. This includes those who can type a prompt, expanding the TAM beyond traditional developers.
* **End-Users (Consumers):** Everyone, particularly a massive global youth audience, who will use the AI apps created on the platform.
* **Ad Providers (Brands):** Companies seeking to reach the valuable youth demographic through AI-native apps.

**Team:**

    * The founders have a decade-long collaboration, building strong synergy and shared vision, backed by AI and scaling experience.
    * The planned team includes senior AI-Ops & Infra specialists for GPU fleet optimization and scaling, and Growth & Developer Relations personnel.
* **Operating model of the company/team - where will you base the team, how are you spending time together and which mechanisms they have put in place / will put in place to ensure you keep growing together more closely**
  > add community (dev, users, moderators)
    * The company will be primarily based in Berlin, with an office in Lichtenberg that can accommodate at least 6 team members.
    * Thomas Haferlach and Elliot Fouchy will lead operations from the Berlin office, establishing a strong central presence.

**Unit economics:**

* **Revenue Model:** Primarily Ad-Revenue, with a 50% revenue share model with creators.
* **Target eCPM:** €6–€12 (rewarded/interstitial mid-tier markets).
* **Back-of-Envelope Revenue Math:** At 100 million monthly impressions and 30% take-rate for Pollinations, this implies €1.8M - €3.6M per month for Pollinations (the document states €18-36M ARR, which would be €1.5M - €3M per month).
* **Cost Structure (based on €300k pre-seed allocation):**
    * Payrolls: 20% (€60,000) (The slide deck fundraising slide differs: AIOps/Data Scientist 50% and Operations 12%, totaling 62% for personnel-related costs from the 300k ask).
    * ML DevOps / Data Analysis: 30% (€90,000).
    * Cloud Computing: 33.33% (€100,000).
    * Marketing: 6.67% (€20,000) (Slide deck: 5%).
    * Legal / Operation: 10.00% (€30,000).
* The company is currently at ≈ $0 ARR (basic text-ad append for *unregistered* apps only - Live).
* The goal is to achieve $1M ARR run-rate by late Q1 2026.

**Market:**

* **Please provide a calculation/estimation of the market (TAM/SAM/SOM)** (Global - 2025 Base)
    * **TAM (Connected Youth):** 948 Million Users; US $247 Billion Annual Ad Spend Potential.
    * **SAM (Digitally Mature Youth):** 600 Million Users; US $99 Billion Annual Ad Spend Potential.
    * **SOM (Early Vibe Coders):** 5 Million Users; US $0.5 Billion Annual Ad Spend Potential.
    * The pitch deck also mentions the Generative AI creator economy TAM is > $10 Billion.
* **Fragmentation:**
    * The market has various players focusing on different aspects like GIF APIs (GIPHY), Image CDNs (Unsplash), Game Ad SDKs (Unity, AppLovin), and AI Search with ads (Perplexity). This suggests some fragmentation, with Pollinations aiming to be a unifying platform for AI media monetization.
* **Barriers to entry:**
    * **Technology and Infrastructure:** Building and scaling AI models and the required infrastructure is complex and costly.
    * **Community and Network Effects:** Establishing a large and active community of creators and users, creating a flywheel effect, is a significant barrier for new entrants.
    * **Trust:** Building trust with developers and users through open-source and privacy-first approaches.
* **Market access (channels / contact points to customers & suppliers):**
    * **Creators (Affiliates):** Accessed via community building (Discord), developer portals, SDKs, hackathons, targeted outreach, content marketing, social media, paid ads, and referral programs.
    * **Advertisers (Brands):** Accessed via a self-serve advertiser dashboard (beta planned), direct outreach, and partnerships. Pollinations acts as the platform connecting brands to creators' apps.
    * **End-Users:** Accessed indirectly through the apps and experiences built by creators on the platform.
* **Trends / Investor sentiment:**
    * **Market Trend:** Generative AI market is doubling YoY. Gartner forecasts 4x more citizen developers than professional programmers inside enterprises (2023). IDC forecasts 750M new cloud-native apps by 2026.
    * **AI-assisted coding:** GitHub Copilot writes ~46% of code edits.
    * **Youthful prompt-dev growth:** Replit > 20M users, +125% in 18 months.
    * **Investor Sentiment:** API-first media streaming with embedded AI-driven ads is a proven, high-margin model. Lightweight SDKs/CDNs for monetizing creative assets are established (Unity Ads, AppLovin). Native, context-aware ad units plus premium tiers are showing success (Perplexity AI). The "everyone is a developer" wave driven by AI code assistants expands the TAM.

**Competition:**

1.  **Please provide a map of the competitive landscape using a clustering/matrix**
    * The documents benchmark Pollinations against platforms monetizing creative assets via APIs/SDKs and ads. A direct visual matrix isn't provided, but we can cluster them:
        * **Game Development & Monetization Platforms:**
            * **Unity Ads:** Lightweight SDK for rewarded, interstitial, banner ads in mobile games; developers keep ≈ 70%. AI initiative *Unity Vector* for ad targeting.
            * **AppLovin MAX:** SDK + exchange for programmatic video/playable ads; ≥ 70% to devs. *Axon 2.0 AI engine* for campaign optimization.
        * **Media/Content APIs & CDNs (with varying monetization for creators):**
            * **GIPHY:** GIF API with sponsored/branded GIFs in search; no direct creator payouts mentioned for this model.
            * **Unsplash:** Image CDN with branded photos ranked first; opt-in for photographers for monetization.
        * **AI-Native Search & Information (with ad integration):**
            * **Perplexity AI:** AI search with a $20/mo Pro subscription and sponsored follow-up ads/side media tiles; publisher share up to 25%.
        * **General Ad Networks:**
            * **Google AdSense:** JS tag for display & video ads; 68% to publishers.
    * **What are the alternatives for people and how do they actually do it today? With or without invoice?**
        * Creators currently face complex AI infrastructure, authentication headaches, and no built-in monetization for their apps.
        * They might try to integrate ads themselves through networks like AdSense, but this doesn't address the AI-specific backend and scaling issues Pollinations solves.
        * For monetization, they might rely on direct deals, subscriptions, or other methods, which can be harder to implement and scale for individual "vibe coders."
        * The "invoice" aspect isn't explicitly detailed for current alternatives, but Pollinations aims to automate payouts.
