**Unit economics:**

*   **Revenue Model:** Primarily Ad-Revenue, 50% share with creators.
*   **Target eCPM:** €6–€12 (rewarded/interstitial, mid-tier markets).
*   **Revenue Potential:** At 100M monthly impressions and 30% Pollinations take-rate, this implies €1.8M - €3.6M monthly potential for Pollinations.
*   **Cost Structure (from €300k pre-seed):**
    *   Personnel (AIOps, Data Scientist, Operations): ~62%.
    *   Cloud Computing: ~33%.
    *   Marketing: ~5%.
*   Currently ≈ $0 ARR (basic text-ad append for unregistered apps - Live PoC).
*   Goal: $1M ARR run-rate by late Q1 2026.

**Market:**

*   **Market Size Estimation (Global - 2025 Base):**
    *   **TAM (Connected Youth):** 948M Users; $247B Annual Ad Spend Potential.
    *   **SAM (Digitally Mature Youth):** 600M Users; $99B Annual Ad Spend Potential.
    *   **SOM (Early Adopters):** 5M Users; $0.5B Annual Ad Spend Potential.
    *   Generative AI creator economy TAM also noted as > $10 Billion.
*   **Fragmentation:** Various players exist (GIPHY, Unsplash, Unity Ads, Perplexity). Pollinations aims to be a unifying platform for AI media distribution.
*   **Barriers to entry:** Significant tech/infra complexity, establishing community & network effects, building developer trust.
*   **Market access:**
    *   **Creators:** Community building, dev portals, SDKs, hackathons, outreach, content marketing, referrals.
    *   **Advertisers:** Self-serve dashboard, direct outreach, partnerships.
*   **Trends / Investor sentiment:** GenAI market doubling YoY; 4x more citizen developers (Gartner); 750M new cloud-native apps by 2026 (IDC); AI-assisted coding (GitHub Copilot ~46% edits); Replit >20M users (+125% in 18mo). API-first media streaming with AI ads is a proven model. "Everyone is a developer" wave expands the TAM.

**Competition:**

1.  **Competitive Landscape:**
    *   Compared to game monetization (Unity Ads, AppLovin), media APIs (GIPHY, Unsplash), and AI Search (Perplexity).
    *   Pollinations differentiates by being AI-native, offering a broader generative AI focus beyond just games or search, and having a strong creator revenue share.
    * **Alternatives:** Creators manually integrate ad networks (e.g., AdSense) which doesn't solve AI backend/scaling, or rely on direct deals/subscriptions. Pollinations aims to automate payouts.
