# Elevator Pitch

>**Problem & Solution**

**AI is universal**,
yet paid APIs and DevOps still *gate-keep innovation*.
**Pollinations.ai** erases that barrier:
One SDK call spins up:
- *Cloud-scale generative media*,
- *Turnkey hosting*,
- And a context-aware ad plug-in; apps that earn more ad revenue automatically unlock higher model tiers and looser rate limits,
powered by *context-aware ad serving* for high relevance.

> **Traction (Currently unmonetized Powerhouse)**
> 
Our **13,000 Creators**
already drive **3 million monthly End-Users**
generating **100K+ media generations monthly**.

> **Path to Profit**

Our ad stack launches in < 6 months,
*instantly converting* this traffic to **≈€1M ARR (Platform Revenue)**,
hitting breakeven around **8M MAU** (when Ad € / Cloud € Ratio ≥ 1 globally).

> **Vision & Scale (Ultimate Simplicity)**

Just tell your favorite AI dev interface
to use pollinations.ai – *we'll do the rest*.

>**Team & Ask**

Berlin-based **Thomas (CEO)** & **Elliot (COO)**
are raising (pre-seed) to launch the ad-funded automatic tiering (Phase 1) and prepare for Phase 2 (Creator premium subscriptions & optional 50/50 ad rev-share) in 2027.

**AI is universal, yet paid APIs and DevOps still gate‑keep innovation.** pollinations.ai erases that barrier: one SDK call spins up cloud‑scale generative‑media pipelines, hosting, and a context-aware ad plug-in where apps that earn more ad revenue automatically unlock higher model tiers and looser rate limits.

• **Traction:** 13 K Creators already generate 100K+ media generations a month—virtually unmonetized today (€0 ARR).

• **Path to revenue:** Our ad stack goes live within six months, instantly converting existing traffic into ≈ €1 M ARR (Platform Revenue) on day one and taking us to break‑even at ~8 M MAU.

• **Tech baseline (June 2025):** Scalable edge Generative AI APIs (image / text / audio) in production, open‑source React SDK live; Minimal text‑ad append for unregistered apps today.

• **Vision:** Any coding surface—even a microphone—will compile directly to Pollinations infrastructure, letting Creators' apps gain higher tiers/limits through ad revenue without Creators touching a cloud console.

• **Team:** Berlin‑based Thomas (CEO) and Elliot (COO); hiring an AIOps & Digital‑Ads strategist.

We are raising pre‑seed funding to activate the ad-funded tiering (Phase 1) and pave the way for Phase 2 (Creator premium subscriptions & optional 50/50 ad rev‑share) in 2027.

# v2

**AI is everywhere**, but Creators are locked out by complex backends and API costs. At **Pollinations.ai**, we've already attracted **3 million monthly End-Users** and a **13,000-strong Creator community** generating over **100K+ media generations monthly** – all before full monetization.

We provide a **one-command SDK** for scalable AI media production, hosting, and a context-aware ad plug-in where apps by Creators that earn more ad revenue automatically unlock higher model tiers and looser rate limits. Our ad stack goes live in under 6 months, projected to hit **€1M ARR (Platform Revenue) immediately** from existing traffic, with breakeven around 8M MAU.

Berlin-based **Thomas (CEO)** and **Elliot (COO)** are seeking pre-seed funding to launch the ad-driven automatic tiering (Phase 1) and enable Phase 2 options (Creator premium subscriptions & optional 50/50 ad revenue sharing) in 2027.

# v3

While **AI transforms societies**, most Creators can't afford paid APIs or manage complex infrastructure. **Pollinations.ai solves this**: with a **single SDK call**, Creators get scalable AI media pipelines, hosting, and critically, embedded ad-monetization where their apps earning more ad revenue automatically unlock higher model tiers and looser rate limits.

We're not starting from scratch: **13,000 Creators** on our Discord already drive **3 million monthly active End-Users** and **100K+ media generations**. This existing, unmonetized traffic is set to generate **~€1M ARR (Platform Revenue)** within 6 months as our ad-stack launches, hitting breakeven at ~8M MAU.

Led by **Thomas (CEO)** and **Elliot (COO)** in Berlin, we are raising pre-seed funding to activate ad-funded tiering (Phase 1) and unlock Phase 2 models (Creator premium subscriptions & optional 50/50 ad rev-share) in 2027.

# v4

The '**everyone is a Creator**' wave is here, but AI infrastructure remains a bottleneck. **Pollinations.ai** empowers Creators by turning their favorite coding interface – soon even a microphone – into an **AI app factory**. We handle the scalable AI media, hosting, and provide plugins where apps generating more ad revenue automatically gain higher model tiers and looser rate limits.

The demand is proven: **3 million End-Users** engage with **100K+ media generations monthly**, driven by our **13,000 Creators**. We're pre-revenue, but our ad-stack launch in under 6 months will immediately tap this, targeting **€1M ARR (Platform Revenue)** and breakeven at ~8M MAU.

Founders **Thomas (CEO)** and **Elliot (COO)** in Berlin are hiring AIOps and Ad Strategists. **Pre-seed funding** will ignite our ad-revenue engine for automatic tiering (Phase 1) and set up Phase 2 options (Creator premium subs & optional ad rev-share) for 2027.

# v2 (reiteration)

**AI is universal, yet paid APIs and DevOps still gate‑keep innovation.**  
**Pollinations.AI lifts that barrier:** one SDK call spins up cloud‑scale generative‑media pipelines, hosting, **and a system where Creator apps earning more ad revenue unlock higher tiers/limits.**


AI is now woven into every part of life, yet access to paid APIs and DevOps know‑how still limits who can build with it. **Pollinations.AI removes that friction.** With a single SDK call, Creators get instant access to cloud‑scale generative‑media pipelines, built‑in hosting, and an ad-driven system where their apps unlock higher operational tiers through the ad revenue they generate.

**Traction today:** more than 13 000 Creators in our Discord community generate roughly **100K+ media generations every month**. That volume is effectively unmonetized right now (≈ €0 ARR).

**Road to revenue:** our full ad stack will be live in the next six months. Once switched on, the current traffic alone is expected to yield **about €1 million in annualized platform revenue from day one** and push us to break‑even as we reach roughly eight million monthly active End-Users.

**Technical baseline (June 2025):**  
- Authentication tokens are already shipping (`pollinations‑init`).  
- Edge Generative AI APIs for images, text, and audio are in production.  
- An open‑source React SDK is live.  
- Only a minimal text‑ad append runs for unregistered apps at the moment.

**Vision:** any coding surface—even a microphone—will soon compile directly to Pollinations infrastructure, allowing Creators' apps to achieve higher operational tiers via ad revenue, without Creators touching a cloud console.

**Team:** Berlin‑based founders **Thomas (CEO)** and **Elliot (COO)** are leading the company and are now looking to add an **AIOps engineer** and a **digital‑advertising strategist**.

We are raising a **pre‑seed round** to activate the rich ad stack for automatic tiering (Phase 1), finish the Creator‑onboarding toolkit, and prepare for Phase 2 (Creator premium subscriptions & optional 50/50 ad rev-share) in 2027.
