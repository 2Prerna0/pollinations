**AI is universal, yet paid APIs and DevOps still gate‑keep innovation.** pollinations.ai erases that barrier: one SDK call spins up cloud‑scale generative‑media pipelines, hosting, and a 50/50 ad‑revenue plug‑in.

• **Traction:** 13 K Discord creators already generate 100 M assets a month—virtually un‑monetised today (€0 ARR).

• **Path to revenue:** Our ad stack goes live within six months, instantly converting existing traffic into ≈ €1 M ARR on day one and taking us to break‑even at ~8 M MAU.

• **Tech baseline (June 2025):** Scalable edge Gen‑AI APIs (image / text / audio) in production, open‑source React SDK live; Minimal text‑ad append for unregistered apps today.

• **Vision:** Any coding surface—even a microphone—will compile directly to Pollinations infrastructure, letting indie Creators monetise without touching a cloud console.

• **Team:** Berlin‑based Thomas (CEO) and Elliot (COO); hiring an AIOps & Digital‑Ads strategist.

Pre‑seed funding activates the rich‑ad stack and finishes Creator onboarding, unleashing the next revenue inflection.

**AI is everywhere**, but indie creators are locked out by complex backends and API costs. At **Pollinations.ai**, we've already attracted **3 million monthly end-users** and a **13,000-strong Discord community** generating over **100 million AI media assets monthly** – all before full monetization.

We provide a **one-command SDK** for scalable AI media production, hosting, and a straightforward **50/50 ad-revenue share** with creators. Our ad stack goes live in under 6 months, projected to hit **€1M ARR immediately** from existing traffic, with breakeven around 8M MAU.

Berlin-based **Thomas (CEO)** and **Elliot (COO)** are seeking **pre-seed funding** to launch this ad-driven revenue and onboard our vibrant creator base, turning massive engagement into profit.

While **AI transforms societies**, most indie developers can't afford paid APIs or manage complex infrastructure. **Pollinations.ai solves this**: with a **single SDK call**, creators get scalable AI media pipelines, hosting, and critically, embedded ad-monetization with a clear **50/50 revenue split**.

We're not starting from scratch: **13,000 creators** on our Discord already drive **3 million monthly active end-users** and **100 million media generations**. This existing, unmonetized traffic is set to generate **~€1M ARR** within 6 months as our ad-stack launches, hitting breakeven at ~8M MAU.

Led by **Thomas (CEO)** and **Elliot (COO)** in Berlin, we need **pre-seed funding** to activate this ad revenue and scale our creator onboarding, turning vision into a profitable reality.

The '**everyone is a developer**' wave is here, but AI infrastructure remains a bottleneck. **Pollinations.ai** empowers indie creators by turning their favorite coding interface – soon even a microphone – into an **AI app factory**. We handle the scalable AI media, hosting, and provide plugins for ad-driven revenue, splitting it **50/50 with creators**.

The demand is proven: **3 million end-users** engage with **100 million AI assets monthly**, driven by our **13,000 Discord creators**. We're pre-revenue, but our ad-stack launch in under 6 months will immediately tap this, targeting **€1M ARR** and breakeven at ~8M MAU.

Founders **Thomas (CEO)** and **Elliot (COO)** in Berlin are hiring AIOps and Ad Strategists. **Pre-seed funding** will ignite our ad-revenue engine and supercharge creator onboarding for the next growth phase.

**AI is universal, yet paid APIs and DevOps still gate‑keep innovation.**  
**Pollinations.AI lifts that barrier:** one SDK call spins up cloud‑scale generative‑media pipelines, hosting, **and a 50 / 50 ad‑revenue plug‑in.**


AI is now woven into every part of life, yet access to paid APIs and DevOps know‑how still limits who can build with it. **Pollinations.AI removes that friction.** With a single SDK call, Creators get instant access to cloud‑scale generative‑media pipelines, built‑in hosting, and a straightforward 50 / 50 ad‑revenue share.

**Traction today:** more than 13 000 Creators in our Discord community generate roughly **80 million media assets every month**. That volume is effectively un‑monetised right now (≈ €0 ARR).

**Road to revenue:** our full ad stack will be live in the next six months. Once switched on, the current traffic alone is expected to yield **about €1 million in annualised revenue from day one** and push us to break‑even as we reach roughly eight million monthly active users.

**Technical baseline (June 2025):**  
- Authentication tokens are already shipping (`pollinations‑init`).  
- Edge Gen‑AI APIs for images, text, and audio are in production.  
- An open‑source React SDK is live.  
- Only a minimal text‑ad append runs for unregistered apps at the moment.

**Vision:** any coding surface—even a microphone—will soon compile directly to Pollinations infrastructure, allowing indie Creators to monetise AI output without ever touching a cloud console.

**Team:** Berlin‑based founders **Thomas (CEO)** and **Elliot (COO)** are leading the company and are now looking to add an **AIOps engineer** and a **digital‑advertising strategist**.

We are raising a **pre‑seed round** to activate the rich ad stack, finish the Creator‑onboarding toolkit, and unlock the next stage of revenue growth.
