**AI is universal, yet paid APIs and DevOps still gate‑keep innovation.** pollinations.ai erases that barrier: one SDK call spins up cloud‑scale generative‑media pipelines, hosting, and a 50/50 ad‑revenue plug‑in.

• **Traction:** 13 K Discord creators already generate 100 M assets a month—virtually un‑monetised today (€0 ARR).

• **Path to revenue:** Our ad stack goes live within six months, instantly converting existing traffic into ≈ €1 M ARR on day one and taking us to break‑even at ~8 M MAU.

• **Tech baseline (June 2025):** Scalable edge Gen‑AI APIs (image / text / audio) in production, open‑source React SDK live; Minimal text‑ad append for unregistered apps today.

• **Vision:** Any coding surface—even a microphone—will compile directly to Pollinations infrastructure, letting indie Creators monetise without touching a cloud console.

• **Team:** Berlin‑based Thomas (CEO) and Elliot (COO); hiring an AIOps & Digital‑Ads strategist.

Pre‑seed funding activates the rich‑ad stack and finishes Creator onboarding, unleashing the next revenue inflection.

**AI is universal, yet paid APIs and DevOps still gate‑keep innovation.**  
**Pollinations.AI lifts that barrier:** one SDK call spins up cloud‑scale generative‑media pipelines, hosting, **and a 50 / 50 ad‑revenue plug‑in.**


AI is now woven into every part of life, yet access to paid APIs and DevOps know‑how still limits who can build with it. **Pollinations.AI removes that friction.** With a single SDK call, Creators get instant access to cloud‑scale generative‑media pipelines, built‑in hosting, and a straightforward 50 / 50 ad‑revenue share.

**Traction today:** more than 13 000 Creators in our Discord community generate roughly **80 million media assets every month**. That volume is effectively un‑monetised right now (≈ €0 ARR).

**Road to revenue:** our full ad stack will be live in the next six months. Once switched on, the current traffic alone is expected to yield **about €1 million in annualised revenue from day one** and push us to break‑even as we reach roughly eight million monthly active users.

**Technical baseline (June 2025):**  
- Authentication tokens are already shipping (`pollinations‑init`).  
- Edge Gen‑AI APIs for images, text, and audio are in production.  
- An open‑source React SDK is live.  
- Only a minimal text‑ad append runs for unregistered apps at the moment.

**Vision:** any coding surface—even a microphone—will soon compile directly to Pollinations infrastructure, allowing indie Creators to monetise AI output without ever touching a cloud console.

**Team:** Berlin‑based founders **Thomas (CEO)** and **Elliot (COO)** are leading the company and are now looking to add an **AIOps engineer** and a **digital‑advertising strategist**.

We are raising a **pre‑seed round** to activate the rich ad stack, finish the Creator‑onboarding toolkit, and unlock the next stage of revenue growth.
