# Advertising Strategy

## Ad Display Models

### Ad Impressions (Without Link)
When displaying an image advertisement without a clickable link, you're primarily dealing with ad impressions. This model is typically based on Cost Per Mille (CPM), where advertisers pay for every thousand impressions their ad receives. The revenue generated from this model is generally lower because:

1. It only measures visibility, not engagement
2. Advertisers pay for potential exposure, not assured interaction
3. The value per impression is typically lower than per click

### Click-Through Ads (With Link)
Advertisements with clickable links often use a Cost Per Click (CPC) or Pay Per Click (PPC) model. This approach tends to generate more revenue because:

1. Advertisers pay for actual user engagement (clicks)
2. Clicks indicate higher user intent and interest
3. The value per click is usually higher than per impression

## Revenue Comparison

While exact figures can vary widely depending on factors like industry, audience, and ad quality, generally:

1. CPM rates for display ads without links typically range from $0.50 to $4 per thousand impressions
2. CPC rates for clickable ads can range from $0.20 to $2 or more per click, depending on the industry and competition

### Example Comparison
- An ad with 10,000 impressions at a $2 CPM would earn $20
- If that same ad had a 1% click-through rate (CTR) and a $0.50 CPC, it would earn $50

## Additional Considerations

1. Click-Through Rate (CTR): Clickable ads allow for measurement of CTR, which is valuable for optimizing ad performance
2. Conversion Potential: Clickable ads can lead directly to conversions, which may result in additional revenue through affiliate programs or direct sales
3. Brand Awareness: While non-clickable ads may generate less immediate revenue, they can still contribute to brand visibility and long-term marketing goals
