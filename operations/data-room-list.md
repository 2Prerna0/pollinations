### Tips for Setting Up Your Data Room
1. **Keep It Simple & Organized**: Use clear folder structures (e.g., “Team,” “Financials,” “Legal,” “Product”) so that viewers can navigate easily.  
2. **Use Secure Sharing**: Employ a professional file-sharing service (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox, DocSend) that allows you to control permissions and track document views.  
3. **Maintain Up-to-Date Versions**: Regularly update your data room so that everything—particularly financials and team info—reflects the latest status.  
4. **Mark Sensitive Info Appropriately**: Clearly label any highly confidential documents and ensure only relevant stakeholders can access them.
