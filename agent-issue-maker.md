## Issue: Create a Test That Tests Itself

**Description:**
Develop a test that is capable of testing its own functionality. This meta-test should verify that the test logic itself is correct and reliable, ensuring that the test does not produce false positives or negatives.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- A test is implemented that validates its own correctness.
- The test should fail if its own logic is broken or produces incorrect results.
- Documentation is provided explaining how the self-testing mechanism works.

**Motivation:**
This will help ensure the reliability of our test suite by catching issues within the tests themselves, not just the code under test.
