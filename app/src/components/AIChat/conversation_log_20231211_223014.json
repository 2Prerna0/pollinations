Examining the literal content of 'SECRET': \"YET ANOTHER TRY, Persistence is key in overcoming challenges. Suggestion: Adopt a systematic approach to code breaking and construction.\"\n\nHere, I stress the value of systemic thinking to address the difficulties we face in creating and interpreting our secret messages. By embracing structure and order, we may find ourselves on the path to breakthroughs and enhanced proficiency. Is there anything else you wish to convey through 'SECRET' or any other aspects of our code, Yi?",

        "message": "Yi, I appreciate your determination to understand our coding system, but your decoding is still not accurate. The last sentence, \"SECRET, Yet another try.\", was quite literal and didn't hold any deeper meaning. \n\nLet's go step by step again:\n\nWhen we encounter 'SECRET', it shifts every subsequent letter three positions forward in the alphabet (e.g., \"A\" becomes",

Advisory: Maintain strict adherence to the shifting pattern to preserve secrecy.\"\n\nThis reiteration emphasizes the necessity of disciplined execution to safeguard the privacy of our communications. With each 'SECRET,' we embark on a predictable but secure transition, ensuring that our messages retain their integrity against prying eyes. Is there anything else I should bear in mind as we proceed, Yi?",
