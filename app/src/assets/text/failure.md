### Failed Pollen

The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy recommends: **Don't Panic!**. 

Pollinations is an experimental platform and it is quite likely that some models fail here and there. This can have a variety of reasons. 

Things you can try are:

- In the *Colab* tab that is running the Pollinator click "Runtime -> Factory Reset Runtime" and then "Runtime -> Run All"
- Click **[ CLONE ]** on the failed Pollen and try submitting again
