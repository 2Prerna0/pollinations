###### For creators

Generate and stylize royalty-free pieces of audio, images, 3D objects and soon fully immersive 3D environments on the fly.

We curate cutting-edge AI models that are constantly updated. Every creation is unique and free to use.

We prioritize equitable distribution of value for hackers, creators, and all the busy bees who play a part in making art.

###### For companies

Imagine you’re a gaming platform in which players can create 3D objects inside the game just by typing a few words into a box, or an NFT marketplace in which users can create and mint NFTs on the spot. Not bad, huh?
By integrating with Pollinations’ API, users can create all of this and much more without switching platforms.
We are working on becoming the engine for personalized synthetic media - to learn more get in touch at hello @ pollinations.ai

###### For the future

The need to design digital worlds is rising fast but the power is still concentrated in the hands of a few people, making experimentation difficult. But we believe the metaverse should be trippy, and we want it to be built by diverse minds. Soon on Pollinations you will be able to create customized 3D objects at scale and personalized immersive environments within minutes.

###### Mission

Pollinations is on a mission to create a culturally, socially, and financially incentivized ecosystem that rewards creators and developers for their work.

We’re a team of artists, machine-learning specialists and futurists based in Berlin. To join the conversation and talk directly with the coders and creators, come to our Discord.
