Note 1: *This is a free service that runs using Google Colab's spare computing resources, and will not run quickly or sometimes you need to retry a few times when no GPUs are available.*

Note 2: *There are some bugs in the code of Pollinations which result in it becoming desynchronized with Colab. Sometimes one has to go to the Colab tab and click "Runtime -> Restart and Run All" and retry.*

Note 3: *Data is stored on the Interplanetary Filesystem. No information about the user is saved.*
