## About



Generative media algorithms usually impose a barrier to people that are not used to code because they are relatively complicated to use. 

This, in turn, creates all kinds of problems, making generative art monotonous and elitist.  

Pollinations values inclusivity and diversity, attempting to remove obstacles for creators. We believe that we urgently need **diverse perspectives in the AI ecosystem,**. We want to make AI-generated media simple to access and available for everyone. 

Pollinations prioritizes equitable distribution of value for hackers, creators, and all the busy bees who play a part in making art. Pollinations was initially developed and created by Thomas Haferlach and now it's a community-based, open-source, AI art ecosystem, to join the conversation and talk directly with the coders and creators, come to our [ Discord ](https://discord.com/invite/XXd99CrkCr). 


As for now, all the people involved are contributing hours for free to help the platform grow. In the future we want to create a donation payment system, to make the project self-sustainable.
