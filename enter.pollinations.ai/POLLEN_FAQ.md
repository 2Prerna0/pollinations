# FAQ

## What is Pollen?

Pollen is our credit system. $1 = 1 Pollen. You spend it on API calls. Free models cost 0 Pollen (we just track usage for stats).

## How do I get Pollen?

Two ways:
- **Buy packs** with your credit card — goes straight to your wallet, never expires
- **Redeem sponsorship coupons** — temporary Pollen that gets used first, expires 24h after you claim it

## What payment methods do you accept?

Credit cards for now. We're looking into crypto and other options for people in countries with payment restrictions.

## Is there a monthly subscription?

Not yet, but we're considering it based on community feedback. Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/pollinations) for updates.

## Can I try it without signing up or paying?

Yep! Just hit the API — no signup needed. Free models work instantly, no Pollen required.

## What changes when I register?

You keep the free models (with rate limits) and unlock paid models (no rate limits, just costs Pollen). Plus you get daily free Pollen grants.

## How do daily grants work?

Every day at 00:00 UTC, you get free Pollen. It's spent before your purchased balance.

- **Seed** (default): 1 Pollen/day
- **Flower** (request upgrade): 5 Pollen/day
- **Nectar** (request upgrade): 10 Pollen/day

## How is pricing set?

We set prices based on what models actually cost us to run. Check the pricing page to see each model's rate.

## How much does each model cost?

It varies by model. Check your dashboard or the pricing page for current rates. Free models are always 0 Pollen.

## Do free models consume Pollen?

Nope! They're sponsored and just have rate limits instead.

## Will free models always be free?

Yes! We're committed to keeping basic models free and accessible. Only premium models cost Pollen.

## How does my wallet work?

One wallet for all your apps. Top up anytime, use it anywhere.

## What's coming next?

- **In-app purchases** (early 2026) — let your users buy Pollen in your app, you get a bonus
- **More models** — video, real-time audio, expanding the catalog
- **Ads plugin** (2026) — earn Pollen when users see ads
- **Quests** — earn Pollen by starring projects, building cool stuff, etc.
