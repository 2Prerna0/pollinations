## 🔧 Customization Options

Want to tweak your image? You can add these options to your URL:

- `width` & `height`: Choose the size of your image
- `model`: Pick 'flux' or 'turbo' (default: 'turbo')
- `seed`: Use a number for consistent results
- `nologo`: Add this to remove the Pollinations logo
- `enhance`: Let AI add extra details to your description

Example with options:
```html
<img src="https://pollinations.ai/p/A_beautiful_sunset_over_the_ocean?width=1280&height=720&model=flux&seed=42&nologo=true&enhance=true" alt="Customized sunset">
```

This produces:
