## Colab as a Service
- [x] unidirectional communication from colab notebook to browser (DONE)
- [x] check for new media files each time a new line is printed to stdout (DONE)
- [x] send image files as they are created (DONE)
- [x] deploy to Github Pages
- [ ] determine if its possible to programatically run a colab notebook from the start (if its possible we dont have to change the colab notebooks. we could just rerun the whole notebook when a parameter is changed)
- [ ] finish a minimal implementation in the deep-daze colab notebook which allows adjusting parameters and triggering the training
- [ ] extract the python code from the notebook to the python package
- [ ] github action to autodeploy
