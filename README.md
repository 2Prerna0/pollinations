## üöÄ How to Use the [API](/APIDOCS.md)

Using Pollinations.AI is as easy as inserting an image! You can use it directly in your HTML:

    <img src="https://pollinations.ai/p/A_digital_garden_with_AI_generated_flowers_and_data_streams" alt="AI-generated digital garden">

This will display an AI-generated image of a digital garden:

<img src="https://pollinations.ai/p/conceptual_isometric_wireframe_A_digital_garden_with_AI_generated_flowers_and_data_streams?width=384&height=384&seed=-1" alt="AI-generated digital garden">

You can also use it in your browser:

    https://pollinations.ai/p/conceptual_isometric_world_of_pollinations_ai_surreal_hyperrealistic_digital_garden

Replace the description with your own, and you'll get a unique image based on your words!

## üé® Example

Here's what you might get if you use the conceptual isometric world prompt:

[![Conceptual Isometric World](https://pollinations.ai/p/3d_wireframe_blueprint_for_the_prompt_conceptual%20isometric%20world%20of%20pollinations%20ai%20surreal%20hyperrealistic%20digital%20garden?width=512&height=512&nologo=true&seed=-1)](https://pollinations.ai/p/3d_wireframe_blueprint_for_the_prompt_conceptual%20isometric%20world%20of%20pollinations%20ai%20surreal%20hyperrealistic%20digital%20garden?width=512&height=512&nologo=true&seed=-1)

## üíª For Developers

If you're a coder, you can use our APIs to generate images and text in your projects. Here are simple examples:

### Image Generation

    import requests

    def download_image(prompt):
        url = f"https://pollinations.ai/p/{prompt}"
        response = requests.get(url)
        with open('generated_image.jpg', 'wb') as file:
            file.write(response.content)
        print('Image downloaded!')

    download_image("conceptual_isometric_world_of_pollinations_ai_surreal_hyperrealistic_digital_garden")

### React Components

We now offer React components for easy integration of Pollinations.AI into your React projects! Check out our [Pollinations React Components](./pollinations-react/README.md) for more details.

Here's a quick example of how to use the PollinationsImage and PollinationsMarkdown components together:

    import React from 'react';
    import { PollinationsImage, PollinationsMarkdown } from '@pollinations/react';

    const AIGeneratedContent = () => (
      <div>
        <h2>AI-Generated Travel Guide</h2>
        <PollinationsImage 
          prompt="Beautiful landscape of Paris with Eiffel Tower" 
          width={800} 
          height={600} 
          seed={42} 
        />
        <PollinationsMarkdown seed={42}>
          Write a brief travel guide for Paris, including top attractions and local cuisine
        </PollinationsMarkdown>
      </div>
    );

    export default AIGeneratedContent;

This example creates a component that generates both an image of Paris and a markdown travel guide, demonstrating how these components can be used together to create dynamic, AI-generated content.

### Text Generation

To generate text, simply use this URL in your browser or API call:

    https://text.pollinations.ai/What%20is%20artificial%20intelligence?

This will return a text response about artificial intelligence.
