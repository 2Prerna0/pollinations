# Special Bee Request Process (Tier System)

## Overview
Special Bee requests are now explicitly a path to request **flower tier upgrades** for unlimited usage and SOTA models. Users first authenticate at auth.pollinations.ai to obtain seed tier access, then exceptional projects may be upgraded to flower tier.

**IMPORTANT: Follow the 95/5 rule**
- **95% of requests** should receive the standard response directing to auth.pollinations.ai
- **Only 5% of truly exceptional projects** should be flagged for flower tier review
- When in doubt, default to the standard response

## Tier System Overview

- üå± **Seed Tier**: Basic access after authentication at auth.pollinations.ai
- üå∏ **Flower Tier**: Unlimited usage, SOTA models, priority queue access
- üçØ **Nectar Tier**: Revenue sharing (planned for 2026)

## Special Bee Request Process

### Step 1: Evaluate Request Quality
**DEFAULT: Give standard response unless project is truly exceptional**

- Check for live website with real users
- Verify professional team or established organization  
- Look for clear business model or educational value
- Assess potential for meaningful partnership
- Project must meet MULTIPLE criteria to qualify for flower tier

### Step 2: Choose Response Type

## Legacy Process (Pre-Tier System)
### Step 1: Identify Valid Requests
- Search GitHub issues with `label:special-bee-request state:open`
- Verify each issue uses the proper template with required fields:
  - Project Name
  - Project Description
  - Project URL
  - Contact Information
  - Domain/Referrer to Approve

### Step 2: Evaluate Request Validity
- Check that the domain/token is appropriate (lowercase, simple)
- Ensure project appears legitimate
- If insufficient information, comment requesting details and keep open
- If clearly spam/inappropriate, close with explanation

### Step 3: Process Valid Requests
1. **Document the token in tokens_to_add.txt**:
   ```
   ## [Project Name] (Issue #XXXX)
   
   ### Project Description
   [Copy description from issue]
   
   ### Project URL
   [URL from issue]
   
   ### Domain/Referrer
   [token]
   ```

2. **Comment on the issue**:
   ```
   Your token `[token]` has been approved and will be added to our systems immediately. You can use this as your referer/token.
   
   ```
   [token]
   ```
   
   We're implementing an authentication system which will allow you to generate a token or an API key soon. Please re-open if you encounter any problems.
   
   **Please close this issue** once you've confirmed everything is working.
   ```

3. **Ask the user to close the issue**

### Step 4: Update Environment Files
Add the approved tokens to:

1. **text.pollinations.ai/.env**:
   - Locate `WHITELISTED_DOMAINS=` line
   - Add the new token to the comma-separated list

2. **image.pollinations.ai/.env**:
   - Locate `VALID_TOKENS=` line
   - Add the new token to the comma-separated list

### Step 5: Maintain Token Documentation
- Keep tokens_to_add.txt updated with all processed requests
- Maintain summary sections at the top:
  ```
  ### For text.pollinations.ai/.env (WHITELISTED_DOMAINS)
  - [list of all tokens]
  
  ### For image.pollinations.ai/.env (VALID_TOKENS)
  - [list of all tokens]
  ```

### Response Style Improvements:
- **Concise format** based on user feedback
- **Direct @username mentions** for personalization
- **Numbered steps** for clarity
- **Emoji usage** (üå±üå∏üêù‚ö°ü§ñüöÄ) for visual appeal
- **@thomash flagging** for promising projects

### Flagging Criteria for Flower Tier:
**‚ö†Ô∏è BE VERY SELECTIVE - Most requests should get standard responses**

Only flag for flower tier if the project meets **MULTIPLE** of these strict criteria:
- **Proven traction**: Live website with existing users/traffic
- **Business model**: Clear revenue potential or commercial application
- **Professional team**: Company/organization with established presence
- **High-value use case**: Educational institutions, enterprise tools, or significant innovation
- **Partnership potential**: Could lead to meaningful collaboration or showcase value

**RED FLAGS - Do NOT flag:**
- Personal projects or hobby apps
- Discord bots without clear business model
- Minimal descriptions or "testing" purposes
- No live website or GitHub repository
- Individual developers without proven track record
- Generic AI assistants without unique value proposition

**DEFAULT APPROACH**: When in doubt, give standard response directing to auth.pollinations.ai

## Token Guidelines
- Use lowercase for new tokens
- Keep tokens simple, preferably matching the domain
- Maintain original casing for previously communicated tokens
- Both text and image services should have identical token lists

## Handling Internal Tasks
- Remove the `special-bee-request` label from internal tasks
- Comment explaining the label removal
- Use appropriate alternative labels (e.g., "Analytics")

## Deployment
- After processing batches of requests, manually restart services or notify DevOps
- No need to restart services after each individual token addition

## Troubleshooting
- If users report issues, verify token is properly added to both environment files
- Check for typos or case sensitivity issues
- For Cloudflare-related issues, may need to run tunnel cleanup and restart

## Metrics
- Track number of requests processed
- Document types of projects using the service
- Note any patterns in usage or request volume
- Current metrics:
  - Processed: 38 requests in recent batches
  - Standard responses: ~90% (approaching target 95%)
  - Flower tier flagging: ~10% (approaching target 5%)
  - Common project types: Discord bots, educational tools, content generation, personal projects, AI assistants, mobile apps
  - Multiple duplicate submissions identified (7 duplicate submissions from same user)
  - Now asking users to close their own issues rather than closing for them
