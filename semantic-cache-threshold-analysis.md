## Key Findings

1. **85% Threshold**: Still too permissive - includes wrong animals and objects
2. **Word Overlap Issue**: "tiny orange car" matches at 88.8% just because of shared words
3. **Cross-Species Matching**: Dogs and parrots matching with cats at 85-86%

## Recommended Thresholds

### Option 1: Conservative (90% threshold)
- **Pros**: Only very similar prompts match
- **Cons**: Might miss some valid variations
- **Best for**: Production use where accuracy matters

### Option 2: Balanced (87% threshold)
- **Pros**: Good balance of hits and misses
- **Cons**: Still might match some cross-species
- **Best for**: General use

### Option 3: Liberal (85% threshold) 
- **Pros**: Catches most variations
- **Cons**: Too many false positives
- **Not recommended**

## Final Recommendation: **90% Threshold**

This ensures:
- Same animal type matches (cats with cats)
- Color variations still match (orange/ginger/yellow cats)
- Different animals don't match (no dogs/parrots)
- Non-animals definitely don't match (no cars/sunsets)
